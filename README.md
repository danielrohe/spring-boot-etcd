# spring-boot-etcd

## Purpose

Spring-boot-etcd is a [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) library that provides an [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) client to access and manage key-value pairs stored in an etcd cluster. It's useful out-of-the-box.

### Spring-boot-etcd Features

- provides an interface that includes all the functions featured by the etcd API v2
- uses either a list of addresses or a DNS SRV record to help you discover the nodes of your etcd cluster
- includes an automatic update mechanism so that the client can easily connect to nodes in the etcd cluster
- provides auto-configuration so that you can get started without having to write any code

###Inspiration

We created spring-boot-etcd after discovering that current implementations of the etcd client API donâ€™t provide an automatic update mechanism, or use other libraries like [Netty](http://netty.io/) to communicate with the etcd cluster. Also, these implementations are not compatible the version of Netty used by the Cassandra driver.

### Getting Started

Use the following Maven dependency to add this library:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-etcd</artifactId>
      <version>1.4</version>
    </dependency>

You can find the latest version at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.zalando%22%20a%3A%22spring-boot-etcd%22).

###Configuration

Configure one of these: 
- the addresses of at least one etcd node, OR
- the DNS SRV record name for auto-discovery


    zalando.etcd.location=http://etcd-cluster.example.org:2379
    zalando.etcd.serviceName=etcd-cluster.example.com

### Running It

Then, auto-wire the client into your code:

    @Autowired
    private EtcdClient etcdClient;

## Usage

Start an etcd cluster:

    docker run -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 \
      --name etcd quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.0.8 -name etcd0 \
      -advertise-client-urls http://10.170.0.10:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
      -listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
      -initial-advertise-peer-urls http://10.170.0.10:2380 \
      -listen-peer-urls http://0.0.0.0:2380 \
      -initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster \
      -initial-cluster etcd0=http://10.170.0.10:2380 \
      -initial-cluster-state new

Write a small Spring Boot application and add this project as a dependency. Use an autowired field of type EtcdService to inject the service into your bean. Call the methods to retrieve key-value pairs from etcd.
